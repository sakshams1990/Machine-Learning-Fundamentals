# Machine Learning

What is Machine Learning ?

**Machine Learning** can be defined as field of study that gives computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.

## Fundamentals of Machine Learning
### Cross Validation

Cross Validation method segregates the dataset into train and test making sure each portion of the dataset can act as train and test. It is normally termed as N fold cross validation. For e.g. 10 Fold Cross validation means , the whole data set is distributed into 10 parts. In each of 10 iterations, 1 part acts as test dataset and 9 parts act as train dataset. The result is summarised for all the results and are shown.
Apart from train-test split, cross validation is also used in tuning parameters when training a machine learning model.
